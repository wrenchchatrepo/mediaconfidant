## Dimension_Group

Usage view: view_name {
dimension_group: field_name { ... }
}
Hierarchy View File (/looker/docs/reference/param-view)
view (/looker/docs/reference/param-view-view)
dimension_group Accepts A Looker identifier
 (/looker/docs/sql-and-referring-tolookml\#scoping_and_naming)
(to serve as the first part of the name for each dimension created by the dimension group)
Special Rules The type can be time (\#type_time) or duration
 (\#type_duration)
Typically used with a timeframes (\#timeframes) or intervals (\#intervals) parameter Use a datatype (\#datatype) parameter if the dimension group is not based on a datetime field For dimension groups of type: time (\#type_time),
use a convert_tz
 (/looker/docs/reference/param-field-convert-tz)
parameter if you want to prevent automatic time zone conversion Definition The dimension_group parameter is used to create a set of time-based or duration-based dimensions all at once. You define the dimension group, and the dimension group will create a set of individual dimensions for different intervals (\#intervals) or timeframes (\#timeframes). For example, you can specify a dimension group of type: time (\#type_time) based on a timestamp column, and the dimension group will create corresponding dimensions to express the data in time, date, week, hour, quarter, and year.

The form and function of the dimension group are different depending the type value of the dimension group:
Duration type (\#type_duration)
Time type (\#type_time)

## Duration Type Dimension Groups

type: duration is used in conjunction with a dimension_group (/looker/docs/reference/param-field-dimension-group) to calculate a set of interval-based duration dimensions. The form of a dimension group of type: duration is:
dimension_group: dimension_group_name {
type: duration sql_start: SQL expression ;; \# often this is a single database column sql_end: SQL expression ;; \# often this is a single database column intervals: [interval, interval, â€¦] \# valid intervals described below
}
For dimension groups of type: duration:
The sql_start (\#sql_start) and sql_end (\#sql_end) parameters provide SQL expressions defining the start time and end time for the duration. See the Defining the start and end of a duration (\#sql_end) section on this page for details. The intervals (\#intervals) parameter specifies one or more interval units that should be used to measure the time difference. The possible choices are listed in the Interval options (\#intervals) section on this page. The duration values are floored to the nearest integer.

The datatype (\#datatype) parameter is optional. If your dimension group is not based on a datetime you may specify an epoch, timestamp, date, or yyyymmdd format instead. For dimension groups of type: duration, the datatype parameter applies to both the sql_start and sql_end parameters, so be sure the sql_start and sql_end are both of the specified data type. The datatype parameter is described in greater detail in the Specifying the database datatype (\#datatype) section on this page.

Although they are not listed here, many of the field-level parameters (/looker/docs/reference/param-field)
can be used with dimension groups as well.

As an example, if you have columns for enrollment_date and graduation_date, you can create a duration dimension group to see how much time students spent in school, calculated in week and year intervals:
dimension_group: enrolled {
type: duration intervals: [week, year]
sql_start: ${TABLE}.enrollment_date ;;
sql_end: ${TABLE}.graduation_date ;;
}
In the Explore UI, this would generate a dimension group called **Duration Enrolled**, with individual dimensions called **Weeks Enrolled** and **Years Enrolled**.

## Interval Options

The intervals parameter tells the dimension group which interval units it should use to measure the time difference between the sql_start time and the sql_end time. The intervals parameter is supported only for dimension groups of type: duration (\#type_duration). If intervals is not included, the dimension group will include all possible intervals.

| Interval   | Description                              | Example Output   |
|------------|------------------------------------------|------------------|
| day        | Calculates a time difference in days.    | 9 days           |
| hour       | Calculates a time difference in hours.   | 171 hours        |
| minute     | Calculates a time difference in minutes. | 10305 minutes    |

The options for the intervals parameter are:

| Interval   | Description                                           | Example Output   |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| month      | Calculates a time difference in months.               | 3 months         |
| quarter    | Calculates a time difference in quarters of the year. | 2 quarters       |
| second     | Calculates a time difference in seconds.              | 606770 seconds   |
| week       | Calculates a time difference in weeks.                | 6 weeks          |
| year       | Calculates a time difference in years.                | 2 years          |

## Defining The Start And End Of A Duration

For dimension groups of type: duration (\#type_duration), the sql_start and sql_end parameters provide the start and end information used to calculate a time difference. These fields can take any valid SQL expression that contains data in a timestamp, datetime, date, epoch, or yyyymmdd format. The sql_start and sql_end fields can be any of the following:
A reference to a raw timeframe from an existing dimension group of type: time A reference to a dimension of type: date_raw A SQL expression that is a timestamp, such as a reference to a SQL column that is a timestamp A SQL expression that pulls a time from your database, using the appropriate expression for your dialect A LookML field reference using the ::datetime or ::date field type reference
 (\#using_lookml_field_type_references_with_duration_fields)
As an example, suppose you have a dimension named faa_event_date_raw that contains datetime information:
dimension: faa_event_date_raw {
type: date_raw sql: ${TABLE}.event_date ;;
}
You can create a dimension group of type: duration that calculates the amount of time that has passed since the FAA event date. To do this, you can use the faa_event_date_raw dimension as the start time for the calculation, and then for the end time of the calculation you can use your dialect's SQL expression for the current time. This example is for a MySQL database:
dimension_group: since_event {
type: duration intervals: [hour, day] sql_start: ${faa_event_date_raw} ;; sql_end: CURRENT_TIMESTAMP();;
}
In the Explore UI, this would generate a dimension group called **Duration Since Event**, with individual dimensions called **Hours Since Event** and **Days Since Event**.

Referencing intervals from another LookML field To reference an interval value in a dimension_group of type: duration, use the syntax
${interval_fieldname}, using the plural version of the interval value. For example, in the following LookML example, the average_days_since_event measure uses ${days_since_event} to reference the day interval in the since_event dimension group:
dimension_group: since_event {
type: duration intervals: [hour, day, week, month, quarter, year]
sql_start: ${faa_event_date_raw} ;; sql_end: CURRENT_TIMESTAMP();;
} measure: average_days_since_event {
type: average sql: ${days_since_event} ;;
}
Using LookML field type references with duration fields To create a custom duration field, you can specify a ::date or ::datetime reference type for the dimensions referenced in the sql_start and sql_end (\#defining_the_start_and_end_of_a_duration)
parameters of a dimension group of type: duration. The view_name.field_name::type syntax, described on the Incorporating SQL and referring to LookML objects
 (/looker/docs/sql-and-referring-to-lookml\#lookml_field_type_references) documentation page, lets you create a ::date or ::datetime version of a field without casting the references to those dimensions to strings.

For example, suppose you have a created dimension group of type: time with timeframes of time, date, week, month, and raw, defined as follows:
dimension_group: created {
type: time timeframes: [time, date, week, month, raw] sql: ${TABLE}.created_at ;;
}
Using the dimensions created_month and created_time, you can create a dimension group of type: duration that calculates the amount of time between a date from the created_date field and the first day of the month in which that date occurred, measured in weeks, days, and hours:
dimension_group: since_first_of_month {
type: duration intervals: [week, day, hour]
sql_start: ${created_month::datetime} ;;
sql_end: ${created_time::datetime} ;;
}
In the Explore UI, this creates a dimension group called **Duration Since First of Month**, with individual dimensions Weeks Since First of Month, **Days Since First of Month**, and **Hours Since First of Month**. Specifying the ::datetime reference type for the fields referenced in the sql_start and sql_end parameters allows the created_month and created_time dimensions to be treated as timestamps in the generated SQL.

As an example, suppose a user selects the **Created Date** and **Days Since First of Month** dimensions from the field picker. If one of the values returned for Created Date is **2019-03-10**, then the value returned for **Days Since First of Month** will be **9 days**.

## Time Type Dimension Groups

type: time is used in conjunction with a dimension_group (/looker/docs/reference/param-field-dimension-group) and the timeframes
 (/looker/docs/reference/param-field-dimension-group\#timeframes) parameter to create a set of time-based dimensions. For example, you could easily create a date, week, and month dimension based on a single timestamp column. The form of a dimension group of type: time is:
dimension_group: dimension_group_name {
type: time timeframes: [timeframe, timeframe, â€¦] \# valid timeframes described below sql: SQL expression ;; \# often this is a single database column datatype: epoch| timestamp | datetime | date | yyyymmdd \# defaults to datetime convert_tz: yes | no \# defaults to yes
}
For dimension groups of type: time:
The timeframes (\#timeframes) parameter is optional but is rarely skipped. It specifies one or more timeframes that should be generated by the dimension group. If timeframes (\#timeframes) is not included every timeframe option will be added to the dimension group. The possible choices are listed in the Timeframe options (\#timeframes) section on this page. The sql (/looker/docs/reference/param-field-sql) parameter for type: time dimension groups can take any valid SQL expression that contains data in a timestamp, datetime, date, epoch, or yyyymmdd format. The datatype (\#datatype) parameter is optional. If your dimension group is not based on a datetime, you may specify an epoch, timestamp, date, or yyyymmdd format instead. It is described in greater detail in the Specifying the database datatype (\#datatype) section on this page.

The convert_tz (\#convert_tz) parameter is optional and lets you prevent automatic time zone conversion. It is described in greater detail in the Time zone conversions and convert_tz (\#convert_tz) section on this page.

Although they are not listed here, many of the field-level parameters (/looker/docs/reference/param-field) can be used with dimension groups as well.

As an example, suppose you had a column named created_at that contained datetime information.

You want to create a date, week, and month dimension based on this datetime. You could use:
dimension_group: created {
type: time timeframes: [date, week, month] sql: ${TABLE}.created_at ;;
}
In the Explore UI, this would generate three dimensions with the names Created Date, **Created Week**, and **Created Month**. Note how the dimension_group name is combined with the timeframes to generate the dimension names.

## Timeframe Options

The timeframes parameter is supported only for dimension groups of type: time (\#type_time). For dimension groups of type: duration (\#type_duration), use the intervals (\#intervals) parameter instead.

The timeframes parameter tells the dimension group which dimensions it should produce and includes the following options:
Special timeframes (\#special_timeframes)
Time timeframes (\#time_timeframes) Date timeframes (\#date_timeframes)
Week timeframes (\#week_timeframes) Month timeframes (\#month_timeframes) Quarter timeframes (\#quarter_timeframes) Year timeframes (\#year_timeframes)
hourX timeframes (\#using_hourx) minuteX timeframes (\#using_minutex)
millisecondX timeframes (\#using_millisecondx)
Special timeframes

|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| raw                    | The raw value from your database, without casting or time zone conversion. raw is accessible only within LookML and won't show up on the Explore page. The raw timeframe returns a timestamp, unlike most other timeframes that return a formatted string. It is primarily used for performing date operations on a field.                                 | 2014-09-03 17:15:00 +0000 |
| yesno                  | A yesno dimension, returning "Yes" if the datetime has a value, otherwise "No". Unlike other timeframes, when you refer to a yesno timeframe dimension from another field, don't include the timeframe in the reference. For example, to refer to a yesno timeframe in the dimension_group: created, use the syntax ${created}, not ${created_ yesno}. Yes |                           |

Using hourX
In hourX the X is replaced with 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, or 12. This will split up each day into intervals with the specified number of hours. For example, hour6 will split each day into 6 hour segments, which will appear as follows:
2014-09-01 00:00:00 2014-09-01 06:00:00 2014-09-01 12:00:00 2014-09-01 18:00:00 To give an example, a row with a time of 2014-09-01 08:03:17 would have a hour6 of 2014-09-01 06:00:00.

Using minuteX
In minuteX the X is replaced with 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, or 30.

This will split up each hour into intervals with the specified number of minutes. For example, minute15 will split each hour into 15 minute segments, which will appear as follows:
2014-09-01 01:00:00 2014-09-01 01:15:00 2014-09-01 01:30:00 2014-09-01 01:45:00 To give an example, a row with a time of 2014-09-01 01:17:35 would have a minute15 of 201409-01 01:15:00. Using millisecondX
In millisecondX the X is replaced with 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 25, 40, 50, 100, 125, 200, 250, or 500.

This will split up each second into intervals with the specified number of milliseconds. For example, millisecond250 will split each second into 250 millisecond segments, which will appear as follows:
2014-09-01 01:00:00.000 2014-09-01 01:00:00.250 2014-09-01 01:00:00.500 2014-09-01 01:00:00.750 To give an example, a row with a time of 2014-09-01 01:00:00.333 would have a millisecond250 of 2014-09-01 01:00:00.250.

## Time Zone Conversions And Convert_Tz

In general, time computations (differences, durations, etc.) only work correctly when you operate on time values that are all converted to the same time zone, so it is important to keep time zones in mind when writing LookML.

Looker has various time zone settings (/looker/docs/using-time-zone-settings) that convert time-based data between different time zones. Looker does time zone conversion by default. The convert_tz parameter is supported for dimension groups of type: time (\#type_time). If you don't want Looker to perform a time zone conversion for a particular dimension or dimension group, you can use the convert_tz parameter described on the convert_tz (/looker/docs/reference/param-field-convert-tz)
parameter documentation page.

## Dialect Support For Milliseconds And Microseconds

Looker supports timeframe precision to microseconds; however, some databases support precision only to the second. If a database encounters a timeframe more precise than it can support, it will round up to seconds.

## Specifying The Database Datatype

The datatype (/looker/docs/reference/param-field-datatype) parameter lets you specify the type of time data in your database table that you are supplying to the dimension group, which can increase query performance.

For dimension groups of type: time (\#type_time), the datatype parameter applies to the sql
 (/looker/docs/reference/param-field-sql) parameter of the dimension group.

For dimension groups of type: duration (\#type_duration), the datatype parameter applies to both the sql_start (\#sql_start) and sql_end (\#sql_end) parameters, so be sure the sql_start and sql_end are both of the specified data type.

The datatype parameter accepts the following values:
epoch: A SQL epoch field (i.e., an integer representing the number of seconds from the Unix epoch).

date: A SQL date field (i.e., one that does not contain time of day information). datetime: A SQL datetime field.

timestamp: A SQL timestamp field. yyyymmdd: A SQL field that contains an integer that represents a date of the form **YYYYMMDD**.

The default value for datatype is timestamp.

## Examples

Suppose you had a column named created_at that contained datetime information. You want to create a date, week, and month dimension based on this datetime. You could use:
dimension_group: created {
type: time timeframes: [date, week, month]
sql: ${TABLE}.created_at ;;
}
-
In the Explore UI, this would generate three dimensions with the names Created Date, **Created Week**, and **Created Month**. Note how the dimension_group name is combined with the timeframes to generate the dimension names.

## Things To Consider

Dimension groups must be referenced by their individual dimensions Because a dimension group represents a group of dimensions, instead of just one dimension, you cannot refer to it directly in LookML. Instead, you'll need to refer to the dimensions it creates.

For example, consider this dimension group:
dimension_group: created {
type: time timeframes: [date, week, month]
sql: ${TABLE}.created_at ;;
}
To refer to one of these dimensions in another LookML field, use the reference ${created_date},
${created_week}, or {$created_month}. If you try to use just ${created}, Looker won't know which timeframe you are referring to and an error will result.

For this same reason, you should not use the primary_key
 (/looker/docs/reference/param-field-primary-key) parameter on a dimension group if you specify more than one timeframe.

Chat Team Tip: We are frequently asked about the validation error that can occur if you're using primary_key on a dimension_group with more than one timeframe. For more information, check out the Timeframes and Dimension Groups in Looker
 (https://www.googlecloudcommunity.com/gc/Modeling/Timeframes-and-Dimension-Groups-in-Looker/mp/571833)
Community post.

Timestamp data that includes time zone information Some database dialects have timestamp options that include time zone information. This lets you store timestamp data in a single field that may have multiple time zones. One row of data might be stored in UTC, another row in Eastern time. As an example, see the Snowflake TIMESTAMP_LTZ,
TIMESTAMP_NTZ, TIMESTAMP_TZ timestamp documentation
 (https://docs.snowflake.net/manuals/sql-reference/data-types-datetime.html\#timestamp-ltz-timestamp-ntztimestamp-tz)
for information about the Snowflake dialect timestamp options.

In this case, when Looker performs time zone conversions, errors can occur. To avoid this, in the sql parameter of the dimension, you should explicitly cast the timestamp data to a timestamp type that does not do time zone conversion. For example, in the Snowflake dialect, you could use the TO_TIMESTAMP function (https://docs.snowflake.net/manuals/sql-reference/functions/to_timestamp.html) to cast the timestamp data.

## It Is Possible To Create Individual Time Or Duration Dimensions

It is possible to create one dimension for each individual timeframe or duration you want to include, instead of generating all of them in a single dimension_group. You can generally avoid creating individual dimensions, unless you want to change Looker's timeframe naming convention, or you have already pre-calculated time columns in your database. For more information, see the Dimension, filter, and parameter types (/looker/docs/reference/param-dimension-filter-parameter-types\#individual-timeframes) documentation page.

## You Can Change The First Day Of The Week

By default, weeks in Looker start on Monday. You can change this by using the week_start_day (/looker/docs/reference/param-model-week-start-day) parameter at the model level.

Just keep in mind that week_start_day (/looker/docs/reference/param-model-week-start-day) does not work with the week_of_year timeframe because that timeframe is based on the ISO standard, which uses Monday weeks.

## Custom Filters And Custom Fields Don'T Support All Timeframes

The timeframes (\#timeframes) day_of_week, fiscal_quarter_of_year, millisecond, millisecondX, microsecond, month_name, quarter_of_year, and time_of_day are not supported in custom filters (/looker/docs/filtering-and-limiting\#custom_filters) or custom fields (/looker/docs/custom-fields).

## Month, Quarter, And Year Intervals Only Count Complete Periods

The month interval in a duration dimension group only considers a month to have passed if the ending day is greater than or equal to the starting day. For example:
The difference in months between September 26 and October 25 of the same year is 0.

The difference in months between September 26 and October 26 of the same year is 1.

The quarter and year intervals follow the same logic.
