## General Automation Strategy for All Processes

1. CI/CD Pipelines:
+ Centralize all your automation scripts in GitHub repositories.
+ Use GitHub Actions to deploy and manage all aspects of these connections (Cloud Functions, Dataform scripts, Looker models, etc.).
2. Terraform/Deployment Manager:
+ Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to manage GCP resources (API Gateway, IAM roles, monitoring, etc.) and automate deployments.
3. Monitoring and Alerts:
+ Automate the setup of monitoring and alerts for all processes using Stackdriver. Ensure you have alerts configured for any failures in API connections, permission issues, or data ingestion failures.
4. Documentation:
+ Automate the generation of customer-specific documentation using scripts that pull relevant information from your setup (e.g., generated by Terraform or GitHub Actions).
5. Secret Management:
+ Automate the retrieval and injection of secrets (API keys, passwords) into your Cloud Functions and other processes using Secret Manager and GitHub Actions.

## API Connection Automation (e.g., TikTok Ads)

1. Automated API Gateway Setup:
+ Use Pulumi scripts to create and configure the API Gateway.
+ Automate the deployment process by integrating these scripts into a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.
2. Automated API Script Deployment:
+ Write a Cloud Function script in a GitHub repository.
+ Set up a GitHub Action to automatically deploy the Cloud Function whenever changes are pushed to the repository.
+ Use environment variables or Secret Manager to inject API credentials during deployment.
3. Scheduled Data Ingestion:
+ Automate the Cloud Scheduler setup using GitHub Actions to trigger the Cloud Function at regular intervals.
4. Automated Data Transformation:
+ Write Dataform SQLX scripts and store them in a GitHub repository.
+ Set up a GitHub Action to deploy the Dataform scripts to BigQuery automatically.
5. Continuous Integration with Looker:
+ Automate LookML model updates by triggering a Looker deployment action (e.g., via Looker API or CI/CD pipeline) whenever new data models are added or changed in the repository.

## BigQuery Database Connection Automation

1. Automated IAM Permissions:
+ Use Pulumi to automate IAM role assignments, ensuring your service account has the required permissions on the shared dataset.
2. Automated Looker Database Connection Setup:
+ Write a deployment script that uses the Looker API to create and configure the Looker connection programmatically. Store this script in a GitHub repository.
+ Set up a GitHub Action to trigger the connection setup script whenever new customers are onboarded.
3. Automated Data Validation:
+ Create a Python script that runs SQL validation queries to ensure the connection works as expected.
+ Integrate this script into your CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions to run after each connection setup.
4. Automated Dataform Integration:
+ Store your Dataform SQLX scripts in a GitHub repository.
+ Use GitHub Actions to automatically deploy and update Dataform models whenever new customers are added.


## Looker Database Connection with Limited Permissions Automation

1. Automated Permission Verification and Request:
+ Write a script that checks the IAM permissions for the service account using GCPâ€™s IAM API.
+ Automate this check to run whenever a new customer is onboarded, flagging any missing permissions.
2. Automated Looker Connection Setup:
+ Similar to the BigQuery automation, use the Looker API and GitHub Actions to automate the creation of Looker connections.
3. Automated Data Integration:
+ Automate the addition of new datasets or tables to your LookML model using Looker API scripts. Store these scripts in your GitHub repository and deploy them using GitHub Actions.
