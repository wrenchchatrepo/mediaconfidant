# Use LookML refinements to refine views and explores defined in the remote project.

#
# For example we could add a new dimension to a view:
#     view: +flights {
#       dimension: air_carrier {
#         type: string
#         sql: ${TABLE}.air_carrier ;;
#       }
#     }
#
# Or apply a label to an explore:
#     explore: +aircraft {
#       label: "Aircraft Simplified"
#     }
