## Maestro AI Orchestrator: A Multi-Agent System

This project demonstrates how to use the Maestro framework to build a powerful AI system using various LLMs and tools. We've assembled a team of specialized agents, each equipped with unique capabilities. This approach is inspired by the concepts outlined in the Medium article "Design Patterns for Compound AI Systems (Conversational AI, CoPilots & RAG)" by Raunak Jain, which highlights the power of combining multiple agents with distinct roles and expertise to solve complex problems.

### Usage Example:

```python
from maestro import Client, Agent
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

# Configure Maestro client:
client = Client(backend="openai")

# Create agents:
openai_agent = Agent(backend=client)
claude_agent = Agent(backend=client, model="claude-3.5-sonnet")
tavily_agent = Agent(backend="tavily")  # You might need a custom implementation here
deepseek_coder_agent = Agent(backend="deepseek-coder") 
memgpt_agent = Agent(backend=client, server_url="http://localhost:8283") # MemGPT server URL
aider_agent = Agent(backend="aider")

# Example workflow:
def generate_python_code(prompt):
    """Generates Python code based on a user prompt."""
    code = deepseek_coder_agent.execute(prompt) 
    # You can potentially use Aider here for code review or refactoring
    return code 

def get_information_and_summarize(query):
    """Retrieves information from Tavily and summarizes it with GPT-3."""
    information = tavily_agent.execute(query)
    summary = openai_agent.execute(f"Summarize this information: {information}")
    return summary

# Example usage:
print(generate_python_code("Write a function to calculate the factorial of a number."))
print(get_information_and_summarize("What is the latest news about AI advancements?"))
```

### Custom Agent Implementation:

* **Tavily and Aider Agent Integration:**  Claude will be tasked with creating the custom agents for Tavily and Aider. It will be given the following instructions:

   ```
   "You are an AI engineer tasked with integrating Tavily and Aider into the Maestro framework. Please write the code for custom agents that handle their respective API interactions and data processing. Provide clear explanations and comments to ensure code readability."
   ```
* **DeepSeek Coder Agent for Error Handling:**  The DeepSeek Coder V2 Agent will be responsible for implementing error handling and logging mechanisms within the Maestro system. It will be given the following instructions:

   ```
   "You are a software engineer responsible for implementing robust error handling and logging within the Maestro system. Ensure that all agents capture and log errors, providing useful information for debugging and troubleshooting.  Make sure the logs are well-formatted and easy to understand." 
   ```

### Advantages of this Approach:
